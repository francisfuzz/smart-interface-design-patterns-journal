# Smart Interface Design Patterns Journal

Hey, I'm Francis! I work as an engineer for GitHub's Communities organization.

I created this site to share my learnings from [Vitaly Friedman](https://twitter.com/vitalyf)'s [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://smart-interface-design-patterns.com/) course.

My goal is to become an engineer who can _also_ design well. By [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), I can become better than venturing alone in a silo!

## About the site

This is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown and focus on the _content_ of your portfolio.
