# Filters

This particular section was so good I need to watch it again and come back with two case studies. The example of  a shopping site with many variants of several items left an impression on me. With so many products, how do you design the experience for filtering? Do they show up as a sidebar or on top? How does that view shift or morph on smaller (mobile) or bigger (tablet) devices?
