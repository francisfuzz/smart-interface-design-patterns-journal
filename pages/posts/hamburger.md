# Hamburger

The [hamburger button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button) is a button typically place in a top corner of a graphical user interface. It exists to toggle a menu (or [Navigation](/posts/navigation)).

## Questions to ponder

- For a website featuring a restaurant or food product, could you try using a different icon than a hamburger to express the same sentiment of a menu without using the "traditional" hamburger?
- If the hamburger icon is used, will it be the only option to close out the menu or will touching/clicking away close it?
- What are the advantages of placing the hamburger icon at the top of the page versus the bottom or middle of the page, in consideration of the app being loaded on a mobile device?
- Should the hamburger icon still be used on devices with larger resolutions (desktop), or should a different representation take its place?
