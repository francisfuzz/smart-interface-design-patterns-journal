# Navigation

The most impressionable learnings from this section was to always show critical navigation and considering how to communicate "where" a visitor is on a site no matter which page they're in. After that, presenting too many options can may hinder more than help; considering an auto-complete search feature may be more effective in helping them find what they're looking for.

## Questions to ponder

- Case Studies: what sites do navigation well? Why or why not? What would you change to drive a specific behavior?
- What should be prioritized in navigation: is it a specific call-to-action (signing up; donating; purchasing) or achieving a specific goal (reading more about a feature; highlighting a specific policy)? Consider those needs before getting to the code.
