# Accordions

Believe it or not, they're used everywhere: accordions present information in a more compact way.

Design questions to ponder when designing one or many accordions on the same page:

- Is the accordion the same on all major viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop, giant screen), or does it "evolve" depending on the surrounding viewport height and width?
- Does collapsing one accordion close out all of its siblings, or do the siblings maintain their own state?
- Should there even be a need to use an accordion if there's enough available space?
- If the icons are not renderable, how will a visitor know that the accordion can be interacted with?
- If CSS/JavaScript is disabled, how does the accordion continue to function?
- How do you indicate that the accordion is something that can be interacted with by a screen reader?
