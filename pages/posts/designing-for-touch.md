# Designing For Touch

- Mobile matters, period.
- Considering the research done on how people hold mobile devices and which fingers they use (read: thumbs) to get things done is a paramount perspective to keep in mind when designing apps.
- I did not know that the average person opens (unlocks) their mobile device(s) at least 80-times a day. Given the frequency, think about how your interfaces should be snappy and help end-users accomplish their goals in the minimal amount of steps.
- Not everyone has an Apple device. Consider the constraints of network and hardware as a part of implementation.
- Most folks can miss the button or icon that's meant to be pressed; keeping this imprecision in mind, make it easy for folks to get their task accomplished in an acceptable surface area/radius versus an "exact" touch.
